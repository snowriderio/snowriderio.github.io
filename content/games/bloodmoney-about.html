<h2>BLOODMONEY – A Dark Clicker Game That Forces You to Question Every Choice</h2>
<p>BLOODMONEY is not a typical clicker game designed to relax players with mindless tapping and idle rewards. Instead, it delivers a deeply unsettling experience where every click carries emotional weight. Wrapped in soft pastel visuals, this indie horror title hides a brutal moral experiment beneath its charming surface.</p>
<p>Developed by Shroomychrist Studios and released in August 2025, BLOODMONEY quickly gained attention for transforming simple clicker mechanics into a psychological challenge that confronts players with uncomfortable questions about desperation, survival, and greed.</p>

<h2>A Story Built on Desperation and Moral Conflict</h2>
<p>The premise of BLOODMONEY begins with urgency. Your character suffers from a life-threatening illness, and the only available surgery costs $25,000. With time running out and no other options in sight, hope appears in the form of a roadside encounter. You meet Harvey Harvington, a cheerful and oddly generous stranger who offers you a deal: one click equals one dollar.</p>

<h2>Gameplay Overview</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Clicking on Harvey generates money</li>
	<li>Stronger tools increase income per click</li>
	<li>Each upgrade intensifies Harvey's suffering</li>
	<li>Player choices influence dialogue, visuals, and endings</li>
	<li>Progress continues until the $25,000 goal—or beyond</li>
</ul>

<h2>Multiple Endings Driven by Player Behavior</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Good Ending:</strong> Players stop once the surgery goal is met and avoid extreme actions. This ending rewards discipline and moral control.</li>
	<li><strong>Normal Ending:</strong> Players continue past necessity, making questionable choices but stopping short of the worst outcomes. The result is bittersweet, blending success with regret.</li>
	<li><strong>Bad Ending:</strong> Players fully embrace escalation, choosing maximum profit regardless of consequences. This ending delivers the game's most shocking conclusion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Visual Style: Cute on the Surface, Disturbing Beneath</h2>
<p>One of BLOODMONEY's most striking features is its art direction. The game uses soft colors, rounded character designs, and playful animations that strongly contrast with the violent implications of the gameplay.</p>
<p>This deliberate clash between appearance and theme amplifies discomfort. Actions that would be horrifying in realistic visuals feel even more disturbing when paired with friendly colors and smiling expressions. The result is a unique aesthetic that lingers long after the game ends.</p>

<h2>Sound Design and Voice Acting</h2>
<p>Audio plays a critical role in building emotional pressure. Harvey Harvington is fully voice-acted, reacting dynamically to player actions. His tone shifts from cheerful encouragement to discomfort, fear, and pleading, reinforcing the consequences of every decision.</p>
<p>Background music remains subtle but tense, allowing dialogue and sound effects to drive the atmosphere. Together, visuals and audio transform a simple clicker into an immersive psychological experience.</p>

<h2>Who Should Play BLOODMONEY?</h2>
<p>BLOODMONEY is designed for players who enjoy:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Psychological horror with narrative depth</li>
	<li>Games that challenge morality rather than reflexes</li>
