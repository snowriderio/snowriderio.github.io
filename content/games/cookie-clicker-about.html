<h2>Cookie Clicker – Idle Clicker Game</h2>
<p>Cookie Clicker is an idle clicker game where the player produces cookies by clicking and gradually automates production through buildings and upgrades. Originally created by Orteil, the game is known for its long-term progression, exponential scaling, and offline production system. The core loop focuses on clicking, purchasing production units, and managing growth efficiency over time. As production increases, the game shifts from active clicking to idle optimization.</p>

<h2>Core Controls</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Left Click:</strong> Click the large cookie to generate cookies. Also used to buy buildings and upgrades.</li>
	<li><strong>Ctrl + Click:</strong> Buy 10 units of a selected building.</li>
	<li><strong>Shift + Click:</strong> Buy 100 units.</li>
	<li><strong>Ctrl + Shift + Click:</strong> Buy the maximum affordable amount.</li>
	<li><strong>Number keys (1–0):</strong> Quick-select building types.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Features</h2>

<h3>Idle Production System</h3>
<p>Cookie Clicker continues generating cookies while the browser is closed. Offline production is a core mechanic, allowing players to return later and collect accumulated cookies.</p>

<h3>Buildings and Automation</h3>
<p>The game includes 20 building types, starting from simple Cursors and progressing to advanced production units. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Cursor:</strong> Automatically clicks once every 10 seconds.</li>
	<li><strong>Grandma:</strong> Produces cookies continuously.</li>
	<li><strong>Farm:</strong> Generates cookies at a higher base rate.</li>
	<li>Additional buildings unlock later and scale production further.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Upgrades and Achievements</h3>
<p>Hundreds of upgrades modify clicking strength, production multipliers, and special mechanics. Achievements track milestones such as total cookies baked or buildings owned. Achievements also contribute indirectly to production through bonus systems.</p>

<h3>Ascension (Prestige System)</h3>
<p>Ascension resets progress in exchange for Heavenly Chips, which provide permanent bonuses in future runs. This system supports long-term play and repeated optimization cycles.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Cookie Clicker is an idle clicker game built around automated production, exponential scaling, and long-term progression. The gameplay emphasizes efficiency, timing, and optimization rather than reflex skill. With offline progress, a prestige system, and hundreds of upgrades, Cookie Clicker remains a reference point for the idle game genre.</p>
