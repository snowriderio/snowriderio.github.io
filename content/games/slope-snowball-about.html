<p>Slope SnowBall is a winter-themed endless running game where players control a rolling snowball across narrow, snow-covered slopes filled with obstacles. The objective is straightforward: keep the snowball on the track for as long as possible while avoiding collisions and falling off the edge. As distance increases, speed gradually accelerates, demanding sharper reactions and more precise control.</p>
<p>The game focuses on continuous movement, spatial awareness, and fast decision-making rather than complex mechanics. Each run ends instantly after a single mistake, making consistency the key to achieving high scores.</p>

<h2>What Is Slope SnowBall?</h2>
<p>Slope SnowBall is an infinite runner built around downhill momentum. Players guide a snowball along winding winter roads surrounded by forests, streams, tunnels, and open cliffs. The terrain is generated endlessly, ensuring that every run presents a slightly different challenge.</p>
<p>Scoring is based on distance traveled, with points awarded as the snowball successfully rolls across platforms.</p>

<h2>Core Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
<h3>Rolling on Endless Slopes</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The snowball rolls forward automatically</li>
	<li>Speed increases the farther you travel</li>
	<li>Staying centered on the track is critical</li>
	<li>Falling off the edge or hitting obstacles ends the run</li>
	<li>The game rewards controlled movement rather than aggressive steering.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Obstacles and Hazards</h3>
<p>As you progress, the slopes introduce more frequent dangers, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Smiling square blocks</li>
	<li>Ice barriers</li>
	<li>Trees and narrow tunnels</li>
	<li>Red wall sections inside enclosed paths</li>
</ul>
<p>Quick lateral adjustments are required to avoid sudden hazards.</p>

<h3>Collectibles and Skins</h3>
<p>Gingerbread collectibles appear along the track. These can be spent in the shop to unlock visual snowball skins such as animals and holiday-themed characters. Skins are cosmetic and do not change gameplay behavior.</p>

<h2>Controls</h2>
<h3>Movement</h3>
<table class="home-content__table home-content__table--compact game-about-table">
	<thead><tr><th>Action</th><th>Key</th></tr></thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>Move left</td><td>A / Q / Left Arrow</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Move right</td><td>D / R / Right Arrow</td></tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<p>Controls are intentionally simple, placing the challenge on timing and precision.</p>

<h2>Tips for Longer Runs</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Make small steering adjustments instead of sharp turns</li>
	<li>Anticipate obstacles early rather than reacting late</li>
	<li>Keep the snowball near the center of the track</li>
	<li>Focus on survival rather than collecting every item</li>
</ul>
<p>Maintaining balance becomes more important as speed increases.</p>
