<h2>Ragdoll Archers</h2>
<p>Ragdoll Archers is a chaotic physics-based archery game where floppy stickman warriors battle using bows and arrows. Powered by exaggerated ragdoll mechanics, every shot, jump, and fall feels unpredictable and entertaining. Your mission is simple but challenging: eliminate enemy archers, survive as long as possible, and collect skulls to upgrade your character and ammunition.</p>
<p>The game supports solo play against AI enemies as well as local multiplayer, allowing you to fight head-to-head in PvP or cooperate with a friend on the same keyboard.</p>

<h2>What Is Ragdoll Archers?</h2>
<p>Ragdoll Archers is an online archery combat game built around survival gameplay and physics-driven movement. Instead of precise, static characters, archers react dynamically to every hit, making battles both tactical and hilarious.</p>
<p>You start with basic stats and simple arrows. As enemies grow stronger—featuring armor, tricky positioning, and even giant mini-bosses—you'll need sharper aim, smarter stamina management, and better upgrades to stay alive.</p>

<h2>How to Play Ragdoll Archers Online</h2>

<h3>Line Up Your Shots Carefully</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Click, hold, and aim your bow</li>
	<li>Release to fire an arrow</li>
	<li>Longer holds increase power but drain stamina faster</li>
	<li>Watch arrow trajectories and adjust quickly</li>
	<li>Headshots are especially effective and can end fights much faster.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Survive as Long as Possible</h3>
<p>Your primary objective is endurance. The longer you survive, the more skulls you earn. These skulls are essential for upgrading your archer.</p>
<p>To stay alive, you must interact with flying apples that appear during combat:</p>
<table class="home-content__table home-content__table--compact game-about-table">
	<thead><tr><th>Apple Type</th><th>Effect</th></tr></thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>Red Apple</td><td>Restores health</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Green Apple</td><td>Restores stamina</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Golden Apple</td><td>Restores both health and stamina</td></tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<p>Consistently hitting apples is the key to long survival runs.</p>

<h3>Customize Your Ammunition</h3>
<p>As you progress, you unlock a wide variety of arrow types, allowing you to adapt to different combat situations. Available arrows include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Electric arrows</li>
	<li>Poison arrows</li>
	<li>Balloon arrows</li>
	<li>Axe-style projectiles</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also unlock additional arrow slots, letting you carry multiple arrow types at once and switch strategies mid-fight.</p>

<h3>Upgrade Your Abilities with Skulls</h3>
<p>Skulls are earned by defeating enemies, with stronger foes rewarding more currency. Use skulls to upgrade:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Health and stamina</li>
	<li>Damage output</li>
	<li>Pull speed</li>
	<li>Armor and survivability</li>
