<h2>Basketball Stars – Fast-Paced Street Basketball Battles</h2>
<p>Basketball Stars drops players into short, explosive basketball matches where reflexes, timing, and smart decision-making matter more than complicated rules. With its cartoon-style visuals and exaggerated characters, the game feels lighthearted at first glance—but winning consistently requires skill, awareness, and tactical play on both offense and defense.</p>

<h2>Winning Isn't Easy—And That's the Fun Part</h2>
<p>The controls in Basketball Stars are simple, but victory is not guaranteed. Every successful shot depends on distance, timing, and pressure from your opponent. A poorly calculated throw can be blocked, stolen, or completely miss the basket.</p>
<p>Scoring alone isn't enough. Strong defense often decides matches, especially in the final seconds when protecting your hoop becomes more important than chasing risky points. Knowing when to attack and when to defend is the key difference between casual play and consistent wins.</p>

<h2>How Matches Work</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Move, jump, steal, block, and shoot in real time</li>
	<li>Score points by landing successful shots or dunks</li>
	<li>Use special abilities like Super Shots at the right moment</li>
	<li>Compete against AI or real players depending on the mode</li>
</ul>
