<p>Ski Frenzy is an arcade-style endless runner that places players on steep, snow-covered mountains while an avalanche relentlessly chases from behind. Instead of focusing purely on speed, the game challenges players to balance momentum, obstacle avoidance, and aerial control as they ski downhill. Every run becomes a test of reaction speed, positioning, and decision-making under pressure.</p>
<p>Players take control of Sven or Evana, two skiers racing to survive as long as possible while collecting coins, performing tricks, and using environmental advantages to stay ahead of danger.</p>

<h2>What Is Ski Frenzy?</h2>
<p>Ski Frenzy is a fast-paced downhill skiing game developed by AZGames. The core objective is to outrun an avalanche while navigating hazardous terrain filled with rocks, trees, cliffs, and gaps.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional racing games, Ski Frenzy combines endless runner mechanics with stunt-based scoring and rideable companions, creating a gameplay loop that rewards both survival and technical execution.</p>

<h2>Core Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
<h3>Downhill Survival</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Ski continuously downhill while the avalanche advances</li>
	<li>Colliding with obstacles slows movement and increases risk</li>
	<li>Quick recovery after crashes is essential to avoid being caught</li>
	<li>The terrain becomes more demanding as the run progresses, requiring sharper reactions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Animal Rides and Vehicles</h3>
<p>During runs, players can jump onto animal companions and vehicles that alter movement behavior:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Penguins</strong> – Faster sliding on ice</li>
	<li><strong>Yetis</strong> – Break through obstacles</li>
	<li><strong>Eagles</strong> – Fly over terrain and hazards</li>
</ul>
<p>Multiple rides can be chained together, creating longer and safer runs when used correctly.</p>

<h3>Tricks and Scoring</h3>
<p>Performing flips and spins increases score output. However, poorly timed landings can result in crashes that cost speed or end the run entirely. Controlled execution is more valuable than excessive trick attempts.</p>

<h2>Game Modes and Progression</h2>
<p>Ski Frenzy offers multiple environments and progression goals:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Endless downhill runs focused on distance and score</li>
	<li>Unlockable world maps such as Jurassic Lark and Twister Canyon</li>
	<li>Vehicles like snowmobiles that improve speed and jump height</li>
	<li>Coins collected during runs are used to unlock maps, upgrades, and enhancements.</li>
</ul>
