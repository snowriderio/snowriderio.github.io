<h2>What Is Escape School Duel?</h2>
<p>Escape School Duel is a competitive platformer set inside a locked-down campus designed like a maze. Players must navigate corridors, classrooms, and guarded choke points while avoiding capture by teachers and the principal. The objective is to reach the final exit before being caught, either by setting a solo record or defeating a second player in a head-to-head race. The game combines continuous running mechanics with precision-based double jumping, requiring calculated route selection rather than reckless speed.</p>
<p>Escape School Duel is a browser-based escape platform game focused on timing, memorization, and controlled movement. Each map features branching paths, guarded hallways, and trap sections that reward players who learn layouts over repeated runs. Solo mode emphasizes efficiency and clean execution. Two-player mode introduces competitive pressure, where small mistakes can immediately determine the winner.</p>

<h2>Core Gameplay Structure</h2>
<h3>Movement and Navigation</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Continuous running through maze-style corridors</li>
	<li>Double jump for clearing gaps or correcting mid-air errors</li>
	<li>Sprint mechanic for faster route completion</li>
	<li>Memorization of patrol routes for safe passage</li>
</ul>
<p>Precision movement is more effective than constant sprinting.</p>

<h3>Faculty Patrol System</h3>
<p>Teachers and the principal patrol specific routes. These characters create dynamic danger zones that force players to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Wait for safe timing windows</li>
	<li>Switch lanes quickly</li>
	<li>Use double jump to bypass guarded segments</li>
</ul>
<p>Rushing directly into patrol zones usually results in capture.</p>

<h3>Rewards and Customization</h3>
<p>During runs, players collect tickets and money. These can be exchanged for cosmetic upgrades such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Wings</li>
	<li>Backpacks</li>
	<li>Hats and glasses</li>
	<li>Mascots</li>
</ul>
<p>Customization does not affect gameplay performance.</p>

<h2>Game Modes</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Solo Mode</strong> – Focus on route optimization and personal records</li>
	<li><strong>Two-Player Duel</strong> – Compete on the same screen to reach the exit first</li>
</ul>
<p>Successful escapes unlock bonus areas as additional rewards.</p>
