<h2>Crossy Road – Endless Arcade Crossing Game</h2>
<p>Crossy Road is an endless arcade crossing game where the player controls a character moving forward across roads, rivers, and railways. Developed by Hipster Whale, the game is available on mobile platforms and can also be played online in a browser without installation.</p>

<h2>Core Controls</h2>
<p>Crossy Road uses simple, tap-based controls designed for quick input:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Tap / Click:</strong> Move one step forward</li>
	<li><strong>Swipe Left / Right or Arrow Keys:</strong> Move sideways</li>
	<li><strong>Arrow Down:</strong> Step backward (limited use)</li>
	<li>Do not stay idle: The screen scrolls forward automatically.</li>
	<li>If the player pauses too long, an eagle will remove the character, ending the run.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Main Gameplay Loop</h2>
<p>Each step forward increases the score by one point. The environment generates randomly, mixing roads, rivers, railways, trees, and static obstacles. Vehicles and trains move at different speeds, requiring timing rather than memorization. Rivers can only be crossed by landing on floating logs or platforms.</p>

<h2>Key Features</h2>

<h3>Endless Arcade Structure</h3>
<p>There is no final stage or endpoint. Each run aims to surpass previous scores. Progress is measured only by distance traveled and coins collected.</p>

<h3>Scoring System</h3>
<ul>
	<li>+1 point for each forward step</li>
	<li>Coins add progression value but do not directly increase score</li>
	<li>Higher distance = higher leaderboard ranking</li>
</ul>

<h3>No Fixed Levels</h3>
<p>Crossy Road uses procedural generation. Each run presents a different layout, preventing memorization and encouraging situational awareness.</p>

<h3>Example Character Unlock Table</h3>
<table class="home-content__table home-content__table--compact game-about-table">
	<thead><tr><th>Character</th><th>Type</th><th>Unlock Condition</th></tr></thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>Chicken</td><td>Default</td><td>Available at start</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Duck</td><td>Animal</td><td>Jump into puddles multiple times</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Robot</td><td>Tech</td><td>Unlock via Prize Machine</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Dino</td><td>Special</td><td>Play multiple consecutive days</td></tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<p>Coins collected during runs are used in the Prize Machine, which unlocks characters randomly.</p>

<h2>Tips for Consistent Progress</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Observe traffic patterns before moving forward</li>
	<li>Use sideways movement to wait for safe gaps</li>
	<li>Listen for train audio signals before crossing tracks</li>
	<li>Avoid unnecessary coin risks when paths are unsafe</li>
	<li>Tap near the bottom of the screen to keep vision clear</li>
</ul>
