<p>Block Blast is a classic block puzzle game that challenges players to think ahead and manage space efficiently. The objective is to place geometric blocks onto a grid to form complete horizontal rows or vertical columns, which are then cleared from the board. Each successful clear increases your score and creates more room for future moves.</p>
<p>Inspired by traditional block puzzle mechanics, Block Blast emphasizes logic, planning, and consistency rather than speed or reflexes. While the rules are easy to understand, achieving high scores requires careful decision-making and long-term strategy.</p>

<h2>What Is Block Blast?</h2>
<p>Block Blast is a score-based puzzle game centered on spatial awareness. Players are given a set of blocks and must decide where to place them on the board. Once placed, blocks cannot be moved or rotated, making every decision permanent.</p>
<p>The challenge increases gradually as the board fills up. The game ends when no available block can be placed on the grid.</p>

<h2>Core Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
<h3>Placing and Removing Blocks</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Arrange blocks to fully complete a horizontal row or vertical column</li>
	<li>Completed lines are cleared automatically</li>
	<li>Partial lines do not count and remain on the board</li>
	<li>Clearing more lines creates additional space and extends the game.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Scoring System Explained</h3>
<p>Each block cleared contributes to your total score.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Scoring</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>+10 points for each block removed in a completed line</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Combo Bonuses</strong> — Clearing multiple lines at once or in quick succession grants bonus points:</p>

<p>Combos are essential for reaching high scores efficiently.</p>

<h2>Special Blocks and Challenges</h2>
<p>Block Blast occasionally introduces special elements that affect gameplay:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Bomb or power-up blocks that clear large areas</li>
	<li>Ice blocks or iron cages that restrict certain spaces</li>
</ul>
<p>Removing these obstacles early can open up more placement options and prevent the board from locking up.</p>

<h2>Tips to Achieve Higher Scores</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Prioritize creating combos instead of single-line clears</li>
	<li>Leave open spaces for large or awkward-shaped blocks</li>
	<li>Study the next available blocks before placing any piece</li>
	<li>Clear obstacles early when possible</li>
	<li>Avoid filling the board too tightly without a clear exit plan</li>
</ul>
<p>Logical placement and patience are more effective than quick decisions.</p>
