<h2>Stickman Hook</h2>
<p>Stickman Hook is a physics-based skill game where players control a stickman character using a grappling hook to move through obstacle-filled levels. The core mechanic focuses on momentum, timing, and swing angles rather than traditional running or jumping. Each level is designed to be short but precise, rewarding players who understand gravity and release timing.</p>
<p>The game was developed by MadBox and released in 2018. It is playable directly in web browsers as well as on Android and iOS devices.</p>

<h2>What Is Stickman Hook?</h2>
<p>Stickman Hook is a skill-based arcade game built around swinging mechanics. Players attach a rope to fixed hook points, gain momentum through curved motion, and release at the correct angle to reach the finish line. Progress depends on accuracy and control rather than speed alone.</p>
<p>Levels gradually increase in complexity, introducing tighter hook placements, bounce elements, and layouts that require more deliberate swing decisions.</p>

<h2>Gameplay Mechanics Explained</h2>
<p>Each level follows a consistent structure:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Hook onto anchor points placed throughout the stage</li>
	<li>Build momentum through controlled swings</li>
	<li>Release at the optimal moment to advance</li>
	<li>Avoid falling by managing swing height and speed</li>
</ul>
<p>Some stages include bounce pads and alternate routes, allowing skilled players to complete levels faster or discover shortcuts.</p>

<h2>Controls and Input</h2>

<h3>Desktop Controls</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Hold Left Mouse Button or Spacebar to attach the hook</li>
	<li>Release to launch forward</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mobile Controls</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Tap and hold to hook</li>
	<li>Release to move ahead</li>
</ul>
<p>The control scheme remains consistent across platforms, ensuring the same gameplay experience on desktop and mobile.</p>

<h2>Levels and Progression</h2>
<p>Stickman Hook features more than 100 levels, each designed for quick completion and replayability.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Early levels introduce basic swing timing</li>
	<li>Mid-game stages add tighter angles and obstacles</li>
	<li>Later levels require precise momentum control and planning</li>
</ul>
<p>Replay runs often reveal alternative paths or more efficient swing patterns.</p>

<h2>Customization and Multiplayer</h2>
<p>Players can unlock a variety of visual skins as they progress. These skins do not affect physics or performance but provide visual variety.</p>
<p>Recent updates added online multiplayer, allowing players to race against others in real time. Success in multiplayer typically favors consistent swing timing over risky shortcuts.</p>

<h2>Practical Tips for Better Performance</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Release the hook near the lowest point of the swing to gain speed</li>
	<li>Skipping unnecessary hooks can help maintain momentum</li>
	<li>Observe level layouts carefully before committing to a swing</li>
	<li>In multiplayer mode, prioritize stability rather than aggressive routes</li>
</ul>
