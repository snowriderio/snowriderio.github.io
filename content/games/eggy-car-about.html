<h2>Eggy Car – Physics-Based Driving Game</h2>
<p>Eggy Car is a physics-based driving game where players control a small vehicle carrying a fragile egg across an endless, uneven road. The main objective is to drive as far as possible without letting the egg fall off and break.</p>

<h2>Gameplay Overview</h2>
<p>Eggy Car is built around a continuous physics loop where vehicle movement and egg behavior are tightly connected. The egg is not fixed to the vehicle and reacts naturally to gravity, slopes, and sudden changes in speed. This creates a gameplay flow where players must constantly adjust acceleration to maintain balance while moving forward. During each run, the player drives across hills and dips, collects coins placed along the road, and continues until the egg falls.</p>

<h2>Coins, Vehicles, and Power-Ups</h2>
<p>Coins appear along the road and can be collected during each run. These coins carry over between attempts and are used to unlock new vehicles. Each vehicle changes how the egg behaves due to differences in shape and handling, but none remove the core balance challenge.</p>
