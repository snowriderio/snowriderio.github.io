<h2>Friday Night Funkin' – Rhythm Music Game Online</h2>
<p>Friday Night Funkin' (FNF) is a rhythm-based music game where players press directional inputs in sync with on-screen notes to win structured rap battles. The game follows a week-based progression system, with each week introducing new songs, opponents, and note patterns.</p>
